# Basic genetic algorithm in Java
* I coded this in my early years during my computer science studies (probably around 2016)
* I haven't touched it since then but I wanted to share it (maybe someone thinks it's interesting)
* It might have a bad code smell as those were my first steps into coding

## What it does
* It uses the principle of genetic algorithms (crossover, mutation, newcomer) to find a solution for the desired target
* The target is an array (either binary, numeric or characters) which should be 'guessed' according to the fitness function

## How to execute
* ```javac GeneticAlgorithm.java```
* ```java GeneticAlgorithm```
